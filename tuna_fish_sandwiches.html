        <h2>What are Tuna Fish Sandwiches?</h2>

        <p>Well, it sounds exactly like what it's called. Its a sandwich, with a filler of a tuna fish salad. This is a recipe loosely based on my mother's during my childhood. Those were the best lunchtime meal, especially with a loaf of freshly baked French bread from the local Winco Food's bakery. I've added a few ingredients to spice things up, so let's get started in prepping this quick and easy, but delicious afternoon meal!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>4 cans of Tune (in oil)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Minced dill pickles</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Red onion</li>
            <li>Lemon juice</li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Add the drained tuna to a bowl. Stir in the rest of your ingredients : Mayo, celery, onion, pickle relish, garlic, and lemon juice. Mix well and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, butter one each side of two slices of bread. I like a white or wheat bread with lots of toast-able surface area.</li>
            <li>Lay one piece of bread in the skillet and top with a thick layer of your tuna fish salad. Top with a piece of cheese (preferably American) and a second piece of buttered bread (butter-side up).</li>
            <li>When the bottom bread is golden brown, carefully flip the entire tuna melt. Continue cooking until the second side is browned. Remove and devour!</li>
        </ol>
