        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>In a 10-inch skillet, heat 2 tablespoons over medium heat. Add the onions and peppers and season with kosher salt. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring regularly until softened (being careful not to brown the onions).
            </li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes and tomato paste. Season with a little more kosher salt, black pepper, oregano, and Aleppo pepper. Cook for a few minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes soften but still hold their shape (5 to 7 minutes).</li>
            <li>Push the tomato and pepper mixture to one side of the pan. Lower the heat to medium-low. Add the beaten egg, and cook briefly, stirring gently as needed, until the eggs are just set. Fold the tomato mixture into the eggs.</li>
            <li>Finish with a little EVOO and more Aleppo pepper and crushed red pepper flakes, if you need a little kick. Serve immediately with thick slices of bread.</li>
